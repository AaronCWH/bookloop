// PREMISE //

To create a community-driven book swapping website, where users can sign up to exchange books with each other. 

Users will be able to view books that have been uploaded, with associated information, such as user reviews.

Users will be able to upload their own books for others to buy, which will earn them points which they can use to buy books that other users upload.

Admins will be able to moderate the website by banning users if need be.
